#Hardware documentation

for Tessel v1.0

## Custom modules

Thinking of rolling your own module or Tessel-compatible microcontroller? Drop us a line at [team@technical.io](mailto:team@technical.io). We'd love to talk!

## Physical layout

![Tessel v1.0 with parts labeled](https://github.com/technicalmachine/tessel-design-docs/blob/master/images/tessel_ports.png?raw=true)

Note that the locations and dimensions of things such as buttons and mount holes may change. There are also multiple debug headers on the current board that may be removed in production versions.

##Module Ports

Tessel is extensible via modules, which connect to the 10-pin, 0.1” (2.54 mm) right angle female headers on the main board. 

* All pins use 3.3V logic.
* Module bank names (A, B, C, and D) are located near the corners of the board.
* Adjacent module ports are currently spaced apart by 0.3” (7.62 mm).
* In between module ports is a 0.13” (3.302 mm) diameter mounting hole with 0.2” (5.08 mm) diameter of route/plane keepout.
* Pins are located 0.1” (2.54 mm) from the board edge.

The following is the pinout for a module bank: 

Pin | Name | Notes
----|------|----
1 | GND  | Ground
2 | 3V3  |  3.3V power rail, marked with a box around the pin on the silkscreen. The onboard regulator is rated to 1A.
3 | SCL  | I2C clock line. Common for the entire board.
4 | SDA  | I2C data line. Common for the entire board.
5 | CLK  | SPI clock line. Common for the entire board.
6 | MISO  | SPI master in/slave out. Common for the entire board.
7 | MOSI  | SPI master out/slave in. Common for the entire board.
8 | GPIO1  | User-configurable general purpose input/output. Unique to each module port.
9 | GPIO2  | User-configurable general purpose input/output. Unique to each module port.
10 | GPIO3  | User-configurable general purpose input/output. Unique to each module port.


## Using modules

Any module can be plugged into any module port and installed using Node Package Manager via the command line. Once physically attached, the module can be attached in software in a similar manner. Each module provided by Technical Machine for use with the Tessel is documented within this repository.
Although modules may occupy more than one physical port (such as the RFID module), they only use the electrical conenctions on one port. The other should be broken out to another header bank on the board.

##Module markings

![Bare GPS v0.9.1 module to deomnstrate standards and best practices for silkscreen on modules ](https://github.com/technicalmachine/tessel-design-docs/blob/master/images/gps_bare.png?raw=true)

All modules include a logo and the name of the module, used for installing via npm, in bold on the silkscreen. The second line of text includes the semantic version of the board and the module's peak (as opposed to average) current draw, expressed in milliamperes (mA). Note that the Tessel's onboard regulator is rated to 1A and that the typical base system requires beteween 300mA and 600mA depending on network usage and memory access. Parts of the Tessel can also be powered off/put into sleep mode to reduce power consumption.
 

##GPIO Bank

* The bank itself is marked by the letter “E.”
* The Pin numbers zig-zag. Pin 1 is located by the board edge near the “E.” Pin 2 is directly above Pin 1 and Pin 3 is directly to the right of Pin 1. 
* 2 x 10 (20 pins total).
* 0.1” (2.54 mm) pin spacing.
* All pins use 3.3V logic.
* Although it is not recommended, the bottom row of the GPIO bank (nearest the board edge) can be used as a module port (port E on the Tessel).

## Design philosophy

The module ports each include power, I2C, SPI, and three GPIO lines, which allows for the design of modules of arbitrary complexity. Note that the I2C and SPI busses are common across the entire board; as such, it is recommended that modules communicate over SPI and GPIO whenever possible. Doing so will mitigate the risks of I2C address conflicts and allow for multiple instances of the same kind of module.

Modules should be devices with clear-cut functionality. That is to say, they should have a single, well-defined purpose or a set of closely related functions, rather than an eclectic mix of capabilities onboard. This requirement is designed to reduce complexity, cost, and power consumption and maximize reusability in hardware and software.


## Future directions/to do
In the future, this repository will include schematic and layout templates for Modules in Diptrace. Versions in EAGLE and Upverter are also planned.

Although Technical Machine is still formulating thrid-party branding documentation and standards, at this time we request that our community reserves the hexagon for first-party and/or approved hardware.
